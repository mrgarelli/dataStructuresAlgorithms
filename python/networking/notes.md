# Scalability Issues
* running out of addresses
* congestion control (insufficient dynamic range)
* routing (node discovering paths)
* security (turning on encryption and authentication)
* denial of service attacks

possible solution: SDN, software defined networking?

# Internet Architecture
* multiplexing: shared use of the same communication channel

| Network Type      | attributes |
|---|---|
| packet switching  | variable delay, sharing of network resources, also known as statistical multiplexing |
| circuit switching | dedicated resources between sender and receiver, busy signals |
