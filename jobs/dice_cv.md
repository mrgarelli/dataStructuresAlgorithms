# About Me
* Worked closely on a world-class software team, deployed to over 5 million users, pair programmed on a regular basis, written encompassing unit and integration tests.
* Demonstrated ability to learn new technologies through multiple roles as a software engineer/ developer (Statistical Analysis, OOP, Modeling, CI/CD, Agile, Mobile Development, State Management, & Branching Strategy).
* I am a pretty fun guy, self taught programmer, linux fanatic, mechanical keyboard enthusiast, vim fanboy, and a straight shooter (if I think something doesn't make sense or we should stop and automate now... I have been know to speak my mind).

# Reasons I would be most excited to join Dice:
1. Would love to learn the intricacies of providing value to a company in the realm of big data. I have been in love with python for a while, and took a machine learnign intro course online. I think my deep interest in linux systems from a user standpoint would transition well into distributed computing. And all around I am an enthusiastic learner.
2. I've lived a few places after university, but quarantine brought me back to my hometown in Chicago & I am set on staying.

# Questions for the team
* What strategies are used to identify and prioritize tech debt in the midst of fast paced development cycle?
* How do you share tools and configuration across the team to make everyone as efficient as possible?
* What actions are taken to share tribal knowledge, promote teamwork, and onboard new employees?
* Are there any running jokes amongst the team?
