# About Me
* I have been a React Native developer for General Motors for almost 2 years now where I have been a key contributor to the General Motors redesign app completely in Typescript.
* During this time I have gained a foundational understanding of a balanced middleware architecture with a sensible App state where highly used selectors become reducers and new stateful concepts.
* I have seen and consumed a declarative architecture to standardize and secularize app components.
* I have worked closely in a team, pair programmed on a regular basis, written encompassing unit and integration tests.
* I am a pretty fun guy, self taught programmer, linux fanatic, mechanical keyboard enthusiast, vim fanboy, and a straight shooter (if I think something doesn't make sense or we should stop and automate now... I have been know to speak my mind).

# Reasons I would be most excited to join this team:
1. Mobile development comes down to the team, and to join a tight-knit group of professionals that crank out quality product I'm sure would be invigorating.
2. The opportunity to learn Golang, one of the coolest up and coming languages, the functional oriented aspects are really interesting. My most recent side project is a Scraper using Gocolly. I think it would be a very worthwhile language to dive into. First thoughts: the environment setup/ package management is a bit weird, but the compile or run concept has to be the coolest thing since buttered bread.
3. I don't claim to be a crypto enthusiast, but after working for GM for 3.5 years, I would welcome a change in subject matter, and jump at the opportunity to learn about a fast growing world trend.
4. I've lived a few places, but never Oregon (kind of assuming things are going to be remote for a while though).

# Questions for the team
* what strategies are used to identify and prioritize tech debt in the midst of fast paced release cycle?
* how do you share tools and configuration across the team to make everyone as efficient as possible?
* what actions are taken to share tribal knowledge, promote teamwork, and onboard new employees?
* are there any running jokes amongst the team?
