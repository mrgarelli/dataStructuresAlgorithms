# Things I've Done (in my brief 3 years of self learning software)
- engineered stateful apps at scale
- explored the testing pyramid (written encompassing unit and integration tests)
- worked closely on a world-class software team (Agile, CI/CD, Teamwork, deployed to over 5 million users)
- modeled complex mathematical systems
- built, configured & cloned linux system
- worked extensively with object oriented programming
- made propositions to stakeholders
- processed and represented low latency, high volume wireless data packets
- weighed branching strategies
- maintained vibrancy & love of the craft
	- always self learning
	- linux fanatic
	-mechanical keyboard enthusiast
	- vim fanboy
	- and a straight shooter ex. if I think something doesn't make sense or we should stop and automate now... I have been know to speak my mind

### Typescript Specific
* I have been a React Native developer for General Motors for almost 2 years now where I have been a key contributor to the General Motors redesign app completely in Typescript.
* During this time I have gained a foundational understanding of a balanced middleware architecture with a sensible App state where highly used selectors become reducers and new stateful concepts.
* I have seen and consumed a declarative architecture to standardize and secularize app components.


# What I'm looking for (in no particular order):
- solving problems & being accountable for clean optimized code
- contributing to open source would be a + as my resume is currently lacking in this area
- opportunity to master golang
	- one of the coolest up and coming languages
	- the functional oriented aspects are really interesting
	- my most recent side project is a Scraper using Gocolly
	- first thoughts: the environment setup/ package management is a bit weird, but the compile or run concept has to be the coolest thing since buttered bread
- continuing my learning in  modeling data, or some exposure to distributed computing as I think my linux knowledge would come in handy there.
- at least peripheral exposure to machine learning; I have been in love with python for a while, and took a machine learnign intro course online, but am hungry for exposure on corporate scale

I am willing to learn, contribute, and stay humble.

# Questions for the team
* What strategies are used to identify and prioritize tech debt in the midst of fast paced development cycle?
* How do you share tools and configuration across the team to make everyone as efficient as possible?
* What actions are taken to share tribal knowledge, promote teamwork, and onboard new employees?
* Are there any running jokes amongst the team?
