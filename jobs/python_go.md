I imagine I'm probably on the lower end in terms of qualifications for this position, so I'll start by emphasizing that through my brief 3 years of self learning software I have explored the testing pyramid, weighed branching strategies, engineered stateful apps at scale, modeled complex mathematical systems, built - configured & cloned linux systems, made propositions to stakeholders, processed and represented low latency, high volume wireless data packets, and had a lot of fun.

With that said, this position checks most if not all the boxes in what I am looking for in a position: python algorithms, opportunity to master golang, at least peripheral exposure to machine learning, opportunity to model data. If there are people at your company willing to collaborate and teach, then I am willing to learn, contribute, and stay humble.
